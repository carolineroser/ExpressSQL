    Description of the main learning objectives for this project
    Description of challenges that you ran into and the process of how you worked through the issues.
    Reflection on how you see this tutorial helping you approach future web projects.

The main learning obejectives of this tutorial was to learn how to add login and admin information, how to enctypt a password, and how to build a site a little different than the last tutorial.
The main challenges that I ran into was spelling, which took a second loook at the code and sometimes a second pair of eyes. I also ran into a few routing problems that I just needed to rewatch that part of the tutorial, or really study the code and use trial and error until finding what works.
After working though this tutorial, I feel that I can use what I learned and customize it to what I would need for either a personal site, or a site for someone else, as it incorporates how to have Bootstrap elements.
